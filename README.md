# Restoraunt Tables

Made with Vite build tool. \
https://vite.dev/ \
Install deps and run project locally. 

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
# open http://localhost:5173/
```

* there are 1000 tables with random data
* emodji used to display table type 
* each 5-10 seconds (this time is random too) data is regenerated to get new warning and guests fields
* blinking animation is syncronized 
* seems like there is no need in react-window (or similar lib), performance is ok with 1000 tables
